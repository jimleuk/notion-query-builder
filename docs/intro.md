**Notion-query-builder** is an opinionated filter query builder written in Typescript for use with the [official Notion javascript client](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-sdk-js).

## Usage
---
This library serves as a utility to write compact yet manageable queries for the Notion API - it is not a replacement for the client. It does this by doing the following:
* **You do not write JSON directly**. This avoids large JSON objects clogging up your code, needing to remember structure and repetitive work.
* You instead use 3 components - **builders, queries and conditions** - to construct your query and only provide the values.
* You can use the components separately or mix with raw JSON if you prefer.

Once you have your query built, you execute the builder to output the JSON which defines your filter. This JSON is then used with the official client.

```
import { Client } from '@notionhq/client';
import nob from 'notion-query-builder';

const notion = new Client({ auth: process.env.NOTION_API_KEY });

const myFilter = nob.filterQuery([
  nob.checkboxFilter('Published', nob.equal(true)),
  nob.multiSelectFilter('Tags', nob.contains(['A', 'B']))
]);

const response = await notion.databases.query({
  database_id: databaseId,
  filter: myFilter.toJson()
});
```
