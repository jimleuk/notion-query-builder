## Usage

As your filter queries become more complex, so does the size of the JSON you'll write for them. Large unwieldy blocks of JSON are always a hassle to reason about and maintain - often, solutions to manage this data utimately leads to code bloat.

`node-query-builder` offers a simple and easy-to-use API to write **filters** and **conditions** programatically, reducing the effort and amount of code required by many factors.

To get started, here's a high level overview of the library:
* filters and conditions are functions which combine to construct a query.
* Usually, filters take conditions as arguments but special filters may take other filters as arguments
* To use with the client, the constructed query needs to return its JSON output. This is usually done by calling the `toJSON()` method.

```
import { Client } from '@notionhq/client';
import nob from 'notion-query-builder';

const notion = new Client({ auth: process.env.NOTION_API_KEY });

const myFilter = nob.filterQuery([
  nob.checkboxFilter('Published', nob.equal(true)),
  nob.multiSelectFilter('Tags', nob.contains(['A', 'B']))
]);

const response = await notion.databases.query({
  database_id: databaseId,
  filter: myFilter.toJson()
});
```
<details>
  <summary>console.log(myFilter.toJson())</summary>

  ```
  {
    "and": [
      {
        "property": "Published",
        "checkbox": {
          "equals": true
        }
      },
      {
        "property": "Tags",
        "multi_select": {
          "contains": "A"
        }
      },
      {
        "property": "Tags",
        "multi_select": {
          "contains": "B"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
